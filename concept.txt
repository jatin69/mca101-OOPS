Using id(variable) to display the unique identifier assigned to the variable

Functions are ALSO objects in python unlike c++
Using print("my func is :", func_name) to display the memrory address assigned to the function

---------

In python
we have names and objects


If the value of 2 variables is same, python may make it efficient in storage,
By using 2 names, for 2 variables
but because value is same, they refer to the same object.
It can be verified using id(var)
( No absolute surety of this )

'''
An object is hashable if
it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime (it needs a __hash__() method),
and can be compared to other objects (it needs an __eq__() or __cmp__() method).

Hashable objects which compare equal must have the same hash value.
Hashability makes an object usable as a dictionary key and a set member,
because these data structures use the hash value internally.

All of Pythonâ€™s immutable built-in objects are hashable,
while no mutable containers (such as lists or dictionaries) are.

Objects which are instances of user-defined classes are hashable by default;
they all compare unequal, and their hash value is their id().
